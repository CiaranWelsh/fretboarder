## Highlights

**ðŸŽ¸ Customize the instrument**
Choose between a  variety of instruments (from ukulele to  11-string guitar) and
tunings,  set  the  length  of  the fretboard,  and  switch  between  left-  and
right-handed fretting.

**ðŸŽ¨ Overlay scales and arpeggios**
The main feature  that distinguishes Fretboarder from other similar  apps is the
ability to display several scales and arpeggios all on the same fretboard.
